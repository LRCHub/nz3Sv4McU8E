Jack Blades)
Used to call me
By my first name
Now you never even call me at all
Used to say
I was your only flame
It was so simple
I believed it all
Now I hear
You got a new friend and lover
Who keeps you warm
On the cool, cool nights
There's a rumor in the air
Don't seem right
CHORUS
Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Taking more than their share
Taking more than their right
Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Used to call me
When you felt the pain
Now you never even feel it at all
Used to swear
That we would never change
And like a fool
I believed it all
Now you say
You had a weekend of trouble
As you stare me down
With those cool, cool eyes
There's a rumor in the air
Don't seem right
CHORUS
Used to call me
By my first name
Now you never even call me at all
Now you say
That I'm the one to blame
Doesn't matter
How I feel at all
Well, I hear
You've got a new friend and lover
You'll take him down
It's so plain to see
There's a rumor in the air
Killing me
CHORUS
