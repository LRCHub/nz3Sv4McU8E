Loss for words, you lost respect
Food for thoughts, you're just a fool
Mind of the weak, with nonsense says

The rumors will never die (The rumors will never die)
The rumors are only lies (The rumors will never die)
The rumors don't let you breathe
Talk is cheap!

Games of lies, just fucking lies
It's all wrong, you're full of shit
Nothing's straight, no!
Low moves, low moves

The rumors will never die (The rumors will never die)
The rumors are only lies (The rumors will never die)
The rumors don't let you breathe
Talk is cheap!

The rumors are only lies
The rumors are only lies
The rumors are only lies

I thought I've heard
I thought I've heard

I thought I've heard, I thought I've said
I thought was right, it's never wrong
I thought I've heard, I thought I've said
It's never right, it's never wrong

I thought I've heard
I thought I've heard

Let it be, just let it be
Never mind, just never mind
That's all you have, that's all you got
Never say what you never will

The rumors will never die (The rumors will never die)
The rumors are only lies (The rumors will never die)
The rumors don't let you breathe
Talk is cheap!

No!
